Unit Testing
============

### What are unit tests? ###

A unit is a small section of code.  Unit testing means you test that bit of code to make sure it functions properly.  This increases confidence in your code.

Unit tests are important when many people work on the same codebase.  If one engineer changes code in one part of the project, you want to ensure that the rest of the project still works.

Unit tests are especially important in dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript, since there is no compiler to catch common problems.
