# Hello Node #
## Introduction to Node in Visual Studio ##

Now that we have our development environment configured, let's launch into the code


### Hello World ###
Open your Node.js Interactive Window, and try the following code

	> console.log("hello world")
	hello world
	undefined

### Hello World as a Function ###
Still in your Node.js Interactive Window, we're going to create a function which presents the hello world greeting.

    > function hi() {
    . 	console.log("hello world!")
    . }
    undefined

Now, we can call the function we just created

    > hi()
    hello world!
    undefined

### History & Editing Functions on the Fly ###
In the Interactive Window, press the up arrow twice, and you should get this

    > function hi() {
    . 	console.log("hello world!")
    . }

We can go in and edit it, and add a more witty remark

    > function hi() {
    . 	console.log("That wasn’t flying. That was falling with style.")
    . }
    undefined

and call it again. This makes it easy to make quick changes.
    
    > hi()
    That wasn’t flying. That was falling with style.
    undefined

###Now You're Set to go to Infinity and Beyond!###
