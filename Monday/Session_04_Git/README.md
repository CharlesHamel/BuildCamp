Session 4: Introduction to Git and GitHub
================================================================

This session will focus on teaching the basics of Git using GitHub.

## What is Git? ##
Git is distributed revision control system created by Linus Torvalds.

Since its creation in 2005, Git has quickly become one of the widely used version control and source code management systems.
## Why use version control?
Have you ever accidentally deleted an important file? Had a computer crash and lost work?

Do you manually zip and/or copy/paste your important files to keep backups?

Have you ever tried changing something, only to accidentally mess everything up and not remember what you did to fix it?

With version control, you can not only back up your projects, but have a detailed history of all the important milestones of your project. You can also share your work with others, and have multiple coders work on the same project at the same time.
## How much does it cost?
Git itself is free! There are various hosting services out there that have different pricing models. For this lesson, we'll be using GitHub.
## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. Don't be confused by the similar name, they are completely different things. You can use Git with a variety of software packages and services. GitHub is just one of the most popular sites for open source projects, and also has its own client to make using Git easier.

GitHub is free for unlimited users, and an unlimited number of open sourced repositories. They charge a monthly fee for private (not viewable by the public) repositories.
## What is open source?
Open source means everyone can see, and download the code for your projects. This allows others to check out, learn from or even contribute to your work. There are a lot of open source software projects that are created and maintained by various members of the community, including Git itself!
## Where else can I host git repos?
There are a lot of different git hosts out there. I would recommend checking out the following:
* Visual Studio Online.
  Website: <http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-online-user-plans-vs>
  Cost: Unlimited projects and private repositories for up to 5 users. Charge for additional users.
* BitBucket.
  Website: <https://bitbucket.org/>
  Cost: Unlimited projects and private repositories for up to 5 users.

#Workshop
##Part 0: Set up
###Download GitHub Client
You can download the GitHub for Windows client by going to <http://windows.github.com/>
###Create Account
To create an account for GitHub, go to <https://github.com/join>

Once you get your account set up, you can start the GitHub client on your computer and log in.
###Configure settings
You will be given the option to set the name and email address you would like to have tied to your commits. Use an email address you don't mind others having, this information will be public!

If you are worried about spam, or simply don't want your email address to be publicly listed, GitHub provides a private email address. 
Simply set your email address to "*username@users.noreply.github.com*" where *username* is your GitHub username.

For more information, follow the instructions here: <https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private>

#Summary
You now know how to use Git and GitHub to create and maintain repositories!

You should try making Git repos for all your software projects. Remember to commit changes early and often, and write good descriptions! This small extra step will eventually save you hours of headache when something eventionally goes wrong. In addition to allowing you to more easily share and collaborate on your work with others.
